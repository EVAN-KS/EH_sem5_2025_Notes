## üìù Notes: Octal Notation in File Permissions

In Linux, file permissions are controlled using **octal notation**, a shorthand based on the **base-8 number system (0‚Äì7)**. This notation makes it easier to represent read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`) permissions for:

* **Owner**
* **Group**
* **Others**

Each permission has a numeric value:

| Permission | Symbol | Value |
| ---------- | ------ | ----- |
| Read       | `r`    | 4     |
| Write      | `w`    | 2     |
| Execute    | `x`    | 1     |

You add the values to get the octal digit:

| Symbolic | Binary | Octal | Meaning              |
| -------- | ------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| `rwx`    | 111    | 7     | Read, write, execute |
| `rw-`    | 110    | 6     | Read, write          |
| `r-x`    | 101    | 5     | Read, execute        |
| `r--`    | 100    | 4     | Read only            |
| `--x`    | 001    | 1     | Execute only         |

### üîß Example: `chmod 751 myfile.txt`

This sets permissions as:

| Role   | Octal | Symbolic | Description           |
| ------ | ----- | -------- | --------------------- |
| Owner  | 7     | `rwx`    | Read, write, execute  |
| Group  | 5     | `r-x`    | Read and execute only |
| Others | 1     | `--x`    | Execute only          |

When you run:

```bash
ls -l myfile.txt
```

You‚Äôll see:

```
-rwxr-x--x
```

This **octal format** helps administrators manage file access clearly and securely.
